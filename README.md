# Mantra Typing App

A simple app for typing mantras. It displays a mantra, and the user types it in the input field. Once the user completes typing the mantra, it fades away and a new mantra appears.

The app can accept a `mantra` query parameter in the URL to pre-load a mantra. Multiple mantras can be passed as comma-separated values.

## Usage

To use the app, simply visit the following URL: https://zachbornheimer.github.io/mantra-typing-app/

Optionally, you can pre-load a mantra by passing a `mantra` query parameter in the URL. For example, to pre-load the mantra "I am worthy of my own time.", you can visit the following URL: https://zachbornheimer.github.io/mantra-typing-app/?mantra=I%20am%20worthy%20of%20my%20own%20time.


To pre-load multiple mantras, pass multiple `mantra` query parameters:
